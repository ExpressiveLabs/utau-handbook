- ## Kinds of aliases in VCCV 2015
    - [-V]
      - Meant for when a syllable starts with a vowel next to silence
    - [V]
      - Meant to extend vowels across notes
    - [_V]
      - Meant for when your missing a [CV] (mostly, in this case, for [ngV]) and to be used with the C_k system (See C_k system for more)
    - [V-]
      - Meant for when a syllable ends in a vowel next to silence    
    - [-CV]
      -  Meant for /CV/ pairs that are next to silences
    - [CV]
        - Meant for /CV/ pairs that are next to vowels or consonants from the last syllable
    - [_CV]
        - Meant to be combinde with onset [CC]s to form onset consonant clusters
        - the only consonants are [r] [l] [y] and [w]
    - Onset [-CC]
        - Meant to be combinde with [_CV] (or [CV]s if a [_CV] isn't available) to form onset consonant clusters that are next to silences
    - Onset [CC]
        - Meant to be combinde with [_CV] (or [CV]s if a [_CV] isn't available) to form onset consonant clusters that are next to vowels or consonants from the last syllable
    - Coda [CC]
      - Falls under the C_k system
      - Meant to be combinde with [VC-]s to form coda consonant clusters next to vowels (see C_k system for more) or consonants from the next syllable
    - Coda [CC-]
      -   Meant to be combinde with [VC-]s to form coda consonant clusters next to sillence, or to be used as a replacement for Coda [CC]s for softer consonants
    - Coda [VCC]
      - Falls under the C_k system
      - Coda consonant clusters used next to vowels (see C_k system for more) or consonants from the next syllable
    - Coda [VCC-]
      - Coda consonant clusters used next to next to sillence, or to be used as a replacement for Coda [VCC]s for softer consonants
    - [VC]
        - Falls under the C_k system
        - Meant to be used for singualar coda consonants next to other consonants or next to a vowel when the consonant doesn't fall on the same syllable (see VC_k system for more)
    - [V C]
        - Meant to transion from a vowel to a consonent that falls on the next syllable
    - [VC-]
        - Meant to transion from a vowel to a consonent that falls on the same syllable, to be put next to silence when a syllable ends in a consonent, or as a replacement for a [VC] for a softer consonant.
    - [C C]
        - Meant to be combinded with a [VC-] to functions like a [VC] but a specific consonant transtion instead of a [k] or [t].
      
- ## C_k System
  - The C_k system refers to how VCCV 2015 uses C_k aliases and [CV]/[_V] for [C.CV] or [C.V] connections.
  - When a syllable ends in a consonant and the next Syllable is just a vowel, using a C_k[_V] pair will reasult in the consonant sounding like it's comeing from the last syllable instead of the next one like how using a [V C][CV] pair may make things sound. (See Consonant Syllable Placement for more)

- ## Consonant Syllable Placement
  - VCCV as a system cares deeply about where Consonants fall in syllables, it changes what type of allies is used depending on where they fall.
    - Examples
      - [p@s.p0rt] should be pharsed as [-p@][@s][p0][0r-][rt-] while [p@.sp0rt] should be [-p@][@ sp][sp0][0r-][rt-].
      - [ku.myu.ni.ddE] should be [-ku][u m][my][_yo][o n][ni][i dd][ddE] while [kum.yu.ni.ddE] should be [-ku][um-][m y][yo][o n][ni][i dd][ddE].
      - [vAr.E] should be [-vA][Ar-][rE] while [vA.rE] should be [-vA][A r][rE].
  - In order for this to be intuetive for the user, it should be clear where consonants fall in syllables
      - Examples
          - SynthV

            - Makes it very clear that the [s] and [p] fall on two different syllables
        - OpenUTAU

            - It's very vague where the [s] and [p] fall, which makes it unclear how this is being pharsed
    - Where consonants should fall is determined by stress, more research is needed to understand how stress and consonant syllable placement interact.

    -  ##  Timings
      -  One of the core principles of VCCV is that it handles the timings of Phonemes for you.
      -  The timing for everything is based on the next notes Pre-utterance, except for [CV]s and [-CV]s.
      -  VCCV relies on Consonant Velocity in order to make sure things sound natural when songs are sung quickly or when there's a lot of fast notes
          - The nice thing about this is that it's extremely consistent, being able to be handled with some math.
          -  There are three different math equations to know about with VCCV, one for BPM, notes faster then 480 and notes slower then 480
              - The one for BPM is $$100 \left(\frac{\text{Song's BPM}}{120}\right) = \text{Default velocity}$$.
                    This equation adjusts the length of the note's pre-utterance to be as if it was recorded at the BPM of the song
              - The one for notes faster then 480 is "(100 - (100 * (note length / 480))) + Default velocity"
              - The one for notes slower then 480 is "Default velocity - (-50 + (100 * (note length / 960)))"
